### Hi there 👋

<!--
**kcelestinomaria/kcelestinomaria** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

My name is Celestine Kariuki, or Celestino for short.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several decentralization/crypto/blockchain projects at Malibia Org, namely:

          * Exitor(Biz Exiting Platform)
          * Harambee(Substrate Blockchain for DeFi)
          * T-box/Tenderbox(product-sourcing and tendering platform for merchants and small businesses)
          
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering Go Lang, Rust, Reach Lang, Algorand Blockchain, Polkadot's Substrate, 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on decentralization/crypto projects, explicitly blockchains, DeFi, and cryptocurrencies in general
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with one of my projects, i.e Harambee, which is a public, permissionless and open-source DeFi Blockchain for Africa. If you are a a Substrate/Polkadot Megamind or are willing to just want to work on something hugely impactful and learn Substrate/Rust, please hit me up. Also if you are a data science whiz who wants to do some token engineering, we need each other, so hmu.
- 💬 Ask me about blockchain/crypto, Rust, Go Lang, Africa, free trade & economics, Algorand, the potential of blockchain/crypto in Africa
