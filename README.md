## Heya 👋

Celestino here. I'm mysterious 🙃

I’m mostly a polyglot developer tbh — I write in Python, JS/TS, PHP (Laravel’s sweet), and Java when I’m feeling dramatic.

I run a tokenization startup — I’ll probably tokenize your fridge. Yes, *your* fridge. If you know what that means, we’re already friends.

Also... I really like soda.  
Like *really really* like soda. 🥤
